This is my first p5 sketch
A black background with a circle at the center. Three triangles with rounded tips bounce off the circle towards the center line of the circle. One triangle bounces from the top, another from the right side, and another in the center. On the left of the circle is a lighter shaded box outlined in white with a ligher shaded triangle inside, corners lining up with the top corners of the box and the it's point touching the center of the bottom side. At this point there is a small white circle. A white circle moves back and forces between the square and the circle.
